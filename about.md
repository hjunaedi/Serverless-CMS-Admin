# About Serverless Headless CMS

This project is a lightweight, serverless Content Management System (CMS) that uses Google Sheets as a database and Google Apps Script as the backend API.

## Features
- **Headless Architecture**: Your data is separate from your presentation.
- **Serverless Backend**: Hosted entirely on Google's infrastructure for free.
- **Image Hosting Integration**: Ready-to-use ImageKit integration for optimized media management.
- **Standalone Deployment**: The frontend is a single `index.html` file that works anywhere.

## Why use this?
Ideal for bloggers, static site generators, and small projects that need a user-friendly way to manage content without the overhead of a traditional database.
